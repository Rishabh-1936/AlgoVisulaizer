## Synopsis
Algorithm Visualizer is an application for professional learners. It provides a platform for viewing and sharing any type of algorithm.  Here user learn algorithms through animation in which algorithm is shown in  pseudocode form. Algorithm Visualizer help you grasp the most complex algorithms by having a look at the animations.

## Motivation

Computer science education is the first obvious application of algorithm animation. Instead of going through the tedious process of explaining using a blackboard relatively complex algorithms to people that have never tackled anything similar before, a computer can be used and the algorithm can be animated, so that the information is conveyed much easier.

## Development setup
Font-End: 
```sh
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
Jquery
```
We've used [particlejs](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) with few modification for the background purpose.

Backend and Server: 
```sh
Java 8
JSP
Servlet
Apache Tomcat v7.0
```
Database:
```sh
 Postgresql

```
